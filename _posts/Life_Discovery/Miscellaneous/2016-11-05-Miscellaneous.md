Today I cleaned up my photo album, and recalled much looking at these photos. The city of Krakow, which is located in the south of poland and the former capital of the country, aroused my desire of travelling. Krakow is one of the most important cities in Europe because of its fantasitic history and culture. I did not know this city until I submitted a paper to an international conference in 2013.

What impressed me most is St. Mary's Church, sitting in the southeast of the Main Market Square in the center of the city. The church has two towers, the taller one of which has a spire and the other one has a dome. The asymmetry of the church illustrates another kind of beauty that I was not familiar with because most historic architectures in China are symmetric. On every hour, a trumpet signal is played from the taller one of the towers and the plaintive tune breaks off in mid-stream, to memorize a brave young man who was shot in the throat while sounding an alarm before a Mongal attack on the city in 13th century. I think it is really touching and important for local people to remember who they are and where they are from.

Besides this church, the city is filled up with more than a hundred churches and chapels and a castle outside. I wish I could have another chance to visit Krakow to appreciate its beauty.
