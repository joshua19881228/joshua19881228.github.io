Yesterday, I thought it was the GPU driver that solve the heat problem of my laptop. Actually, I tried another method which is lowering the level of APM_level (Advanced Power Management level). In the manuel of hdparm, a part of description is as follow:

>Get/set Advanced Power Management feature, if the drive supports it.  A low value means aggressive power management and a high value means better performance. Possible settings range from values 1 through 127 (which permit spin-down), and values 128 through 254 (which do not permit spin-down). The highest degree of power management is attained with a setting of 1, and the highest I/O performance with a setting of 254. A value of 255 tells hdparm to disable Advanced Power Management altogether on the drive (not all drives support disabling it, but most do).

A sample of the commond of changing APM_level is:

```bash
sudo hdparm -B 192 /dev/sda
```

or we can add it to /etc/rc.local
