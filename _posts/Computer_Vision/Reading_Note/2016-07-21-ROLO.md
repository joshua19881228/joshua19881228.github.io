### CONTRIBUTIONS ###

1. LSTM’s interpretation and regression capabilities of high-level visual features is explored. 
2. Neural network analysis is extended into the spatiotemporal domain for efficient visual object tracking.

The main steps of the method is as follows:

1. YOLO is used to collect rich and robust visual features, as well as preliminary location inferences.
2. LSTM is used to regress the location of the object in video frames.

**Some Details**

There are two streams of data flowing into the LSTMs. One stream includes

1. the feature representations from the convolutional layers $X_{t}$, for example the 4096-d feature from the fully-connected layer of VGG.
2. the detection information $B_{t,i}$ from the fully connected layers. Thus, at each time-step t, we extract a feature vector of length 4096. We refer to these vectors as Xt . 

Another stream includes

1. the output of states from the last time-step $S_{t−1}$. 

### ADVANTAGES ###

1. The processing speed is fast because of the YOLO algorithm.
2. History of both location and appearance are considered.
3. End-to-end training is used in tracking, which means that a unified system is introduced.

### DISADVANTAGES ###

1. YOLO may be not the best choice for detection.
2. Only single object is processed.

### OTHERS ###

1. 4096-d feature is a representation for whole image, how about local representation.
2. Is there a method of temporal-full convolutional operation on 3D video, similar with fully convolutional operation on 2D image?
