## CONTRIBUTION ##

1. A new cascaded CNNs based framework is proposed for joint face detection and alignment, and a lightweight CNN architecture is carefully designed for real time performance.
2. An effective method is proposed to conduct online hard sample mining to improve the performance.
3. Extensive experiments are conducted on challenging benchmarks, to show significant performance improvement of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art techniques in both face detection and face alignment tasks.

## METHOD ##

This work is very much like a traditional slide-window based face detection method. A cascade classifier is used to classify an image patch. The first classifier is very simple so that it can efficiently remove easy negative patches. Then more complex classifiers are used to remove harder patches. The last CNN is used as a regressor to localize face landmarks. Along with the classifiers, bounding box is also localized. To handle multiple scales, an image pyramid is built.

### Overall Framework ###

The pipeline of this work is shown as follows. The input image is first resized to different scales to build an image pyramid, which is sent to the three-stage cascaded framework.

**Stage 1:** A fully convolutional network is proposed, called Proposal Network (P-Net), to obtain the candidate facial windows and their bounding box regression vectors. Then candidates are calibrated based on the estimated bounding box regression vectors. After that, non-maximum suppression (NMS) is utilized to merge highly overlapped candidates.

**Stage 2:** All candidates are fed to another CNN, called Refine Network (R-Net), which further rejects numerous false candidates, performs calibration with bounding box regression, and conducts NMS.

**Stage 3:** This stage is similar to the second stage, but this stage aims to identify face regions with more supervision. In particular, the network will output five facial landmarksâ€™ positions.
