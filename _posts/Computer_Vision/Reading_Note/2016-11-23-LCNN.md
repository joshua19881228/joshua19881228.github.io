## CONTRIBUTIONS ##

LCNN, a lookup-based convolutional neural network is introduced that encodes convolutions by few lookups to a dictionary that is trained to cover the space of weights in CNNs.

## METHOD ##

The main idea of the work is decoding the weights of the convolutional layer using a dictionary $D$ and two tensors, $I$ and $C$, like the following figure illustrated.

where $k$ is the size of the dictionary $D$, $m$ is the size of input channel. The weight tensor can be constructed by the linear combination of $S$ words in dictionary $D$ as follows:

$$ W_{[:,r,c]}=\sum_{t=1}^{S}C_{[t,r,c]}\cdot D_{[I_{[t,r,c]},:]}  \forall r,c $$

where $S$ is the size of number of components in the linear combinations. Then the convolution can be computed fast using a shared dictionary. we can convolve the input with all of the dictionary vectors, and then compute the output according to $I$ and $C$. Since the dictionary $D$ is shared among all weight filters in a layer, we can precompute the convolution between the input tensor $\textbf{X}$ and all the dictionary vectors. Given $\textbf{S}$ which is defined as:

$$ \textbf{S}_{[i,:,:]}=\textbf{X}*\textbf{D}_{[i,:]} \forall 1\leq i \leq k $$

the convolution operation can be computed as 

$$ \textbf{X} * \textbf{W} = \textbf{S} * \textbf{P} $$

where $\textbf{P}$ can be expressed by $I$ and $C$:

$$ P_{j,r,c} = \begin{cases}
C_{t,r,c}& \exists t:I_{t,r,c}=j \\\
0& \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

The idea can be illustrated in the following figure:

thus the the dictionary and the lookup parameters can be trained jointly.

## ADVANTAGES ##

1. It speeds up inference.
2. Few-shot learning. The shared dictionary in LCNN allows a neural network to learn from very few training examples on novel categories
3. LCNN needs fewer iteration to train.

## DISADVANTAGES ##

1. Performance is hurt because of the estimation of the weights
