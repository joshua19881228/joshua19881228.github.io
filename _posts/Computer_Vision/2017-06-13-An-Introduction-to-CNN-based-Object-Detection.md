# 2. Brief Revisit to the "Ancient" Algorithm #

## 2.1 Histograms of Gradients (HOG) ##

![Histograms of Gradients](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshua19881228/my_blogs/master/Computer_Vision/Object_Detection_Figures/HOG.png "Histograms of Gradients =640")

* Calculate gradient for each pixel
* For each **Cell**, a histogram of gradient is computed
* For each **Block**, a HOG feature is extracted by concatenating histograms of each Cell

If Block size = 16\*16, Block stride = 8, Cell size = 8\*8, Bin size = 9, Slide-window size = 128\*64, then HOG feature is a 3780-d feature. #Block=((64-16)/8+1)\*((128-16)/8+1)=105, #Cell=(16/8)\*(16/8)=4, 105\*4\*9=3780

## 2.2 Deformable Part Models (DPM) ##

![DPM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshua19881228/my_blogs/master/Computer_Vision/Object_Detection_Figures/DPM.png "DPM =480")

$$ D_{i,l}(x,y) = \max \limits_{dx,dy} (R_{i,l}(x+dx, y+dy)-d_{i}\cdot \phi_{d}(dx,dy)) $$

This transformation spreads high filter scores to nearby locations, taking into account the deformation costs.

$$ score(x_{0},y_{0},l_{0}) = R-{0,l_{0}}(x_{0},y_{0})+ \sum_{i=1}^{n} D_{i, l_{0}-\lambda}(2(x_{0},y_{0})+v_{i})+b $$

The overall root scores at each level can be expressed by the sum of the root filter response at that level, plus shifted versions of transformed and sub-sampled part responses.

# 3. Epochal Evolution of R-CNN #

## 3.1 RCNN ##

### 3.1.1 Regions with CNN Features ###

![RCNN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshua19881228/my_blogs/master/Computer_Vision/Object_Detection_Figures/RCNN.png "RCNN =640")

* Region proposals (Selective Search, ~2k)
* CNN features (AlexNet, VGG-16, warped region in image)
* Classifier (Linear SVM per class)
* Bounding box (Class-specific regressor)
* Run-time speed (VGG-16, 47 s/img on single K40 GPU)

### 3.1.2 Experiment Result (AlexNet) ###

![RCNN_Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshua19881228/my_blogs/master/Computer_Vision/Object_Detection_Figures/RCNN_Result.png "RCNN_Result =640")

* Without FT, fc7 is worse than fc6, pool5 is quite competitive. Much of the CNN’s representational power comes from its convolutional layers, rather than from the much larger densely connected layers.
* With FT, The boost from fine-tuning is much larger for fc6 and fc7 than for pool5. Pool5 features are general. Learning domain-specific non-linear classifiers helps a lot.
* Bounding box regression helps reduce localization errors. 

### 3.1.3 Interesting Details – Training ###

* Pre-trained on ILSVRC2012 classification task
* Fine-tuned on proposals with N+1 classes without any modification to the network

    1. IOU>0.5 over ground-truth as positive samples, others as negative samples
    2. Each mini-batch contains 32 positive samples and 96 background samples

* SVM for each category
    
    1. Ground-truth window as positive samples
    2. IOU<0.3 over ground-truth as negative samples
    3. Hard negative mining is adopted

* Bounding-box regression

    1. Class-specific
    2. Features computed by CNN
    3. Only the proposals IOU>0.6 overlap ground-truth
    4. Coordinates in pixel

### 3.1.4 Interesting Details – FP Error Types ###

![RCNN_Error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshua19881228/my_blogs/master/Computer_Vision/Object_Detection_Figures/RCNN_Error.png "RCNN_Error =640")

* Loc: poor localization, 0.1 < IOU < 0.5
* Sim: confusion with a similar category
* Oth: confusion with a dissimilar object category
* BG: a FP that fired on background

## 3.2 Fast-RCNN ##

### 3.2.1 What's Wrong with RCNN  ###
    
* Training is a multi-stage pipeline (Proposal, Fine-tune, SVMs, Regressors)
* Training is expensive in space and time (Extract feature from every proposal, Need to save to disk)
* Oject detection is slow (47 s/img on K40)

### 3.2.2 R-CNN with ROI Pooling ###

![Fast_RCNN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshua19881228/my_blogs/master/Computer_Vision/Object_Detection_Figures/Fast_RCNN.png "Fast_RCNN =640")

* Region proposals (Selective Search, ~2k)
* CNN features (AlexNet, VGG-16, ROI in feature map)
* Classifier (sub-network softmax)
* Bounding box (sub-network regressor)
* Run-time speed (VGG-16, 0.32 s/img on single K40 GPU)

### 3.2.3 ROI Pooling ###

![SPP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshua19881228/my_blogs/master/Computer_Vision/Object_Detection_Figures/SPP.png "SPP =640")

* Inspired by Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPPNet)
* Convert arbitrary input size to fixed length

    1. The input is an ROI area in feature map
    2. The input is divided into grids
    3. In each grid, pooling is used to extract features

### 3.2.4 Experiment Result (VGG16) ###

![Fast_RCNN_Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshua19881228/my_blogs/master/Computer_Vision/Object_Detection_Figures/Fast_RCNN_Result.png "Fast_RCNN_Result =640")

### 3.2.5 Interesting Details – Training ###

* Pre-trained on ILSVRC2012 classification task
* Fine-tuned with N+1 classes and two sibling layers

    ![Fast_RCNN_Finetune](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshua19881228/my_blogs/master/Computer_Vision/Object_Detection_Figures/Fast_RCNN_Finetune.png "Fast_RCNN_Finetune =480")

    1. Fine-tune the whole network
    2. Each mini-batch has 2 images and 64 ROIs from each images
    3. 25% of the ROIs have IOU>0.5 with ground-truth as positive samples
    4. The rest of the ROIs have IOU [0.1, 0.5) with ground-truth as background samples

        $$ L(p,u,l^u,v) = L_{cls}(p,u) + \lambda [u \geq 1] L_{loc}(t^u,v) $$

    5. Multi-task loss, one loss for classification and one for bounding box regression
    6. ROI pooling back-propagation is similar with max-pooling

* Accelerate using truncated SVD

    ![Fast_RCNN_SVD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshua19881228/my_blogs/master/Computer_Vision/Object_Detection_Figures/Fast_RCNN_SVD.png "Fast_RCNN_SVD =480")

    Implemented by using two FCs without non-linear activation

* Training time

    1. 146x faster than R-CNN
    2. If accelerated with truncated SVD, 213x faster than R-CNN

### 3.2.6 Interesting Details – Design evaluation ###

* Does multi-task training help? Yes, it does!
* Test with multiple scales? Yes but with cost.
* Do SVMs outperform softmax? Interesting…

## 3.3 Faster-RCNN ##

### 3.3.1 Room to improve Fast-RCNN ###

* Region proposal has become the bottleneck
* 2s for Selective Search, 0.320s for Fast-RCNN

* Region proposals (RPN, ~300)
* Classifier (sub-network softmax)
* Bounding box (RPN regressor, sub-network regressor)

    4. Train Fast-RCNN using $’s proposal with shared layers fixed

* Training RPN

    1. Each mini-batch arises from a single image
    2. Positive samples: the anchors with (1) the highest IOU and (2) IOU>0.7 overlap with any ground-truth
    3. Negative samples: IOU<0.3 overlap with all ground-truth
    4. Randomly sample 256 anchors, pos:neg = 1:1
    5. Loss function with Ncls=256, Nreg=~2400, λ=10
    6. Anchors cross image boundaries do not contribute at training stage

### 3.3.6 Interesting Details – Design Evaluation ###

* Ablation on RPN

    1. Sharing: Detector feature helps RPN
    2. RPN generate quite good proposals
    3. No cls, randomly selecting proposal, score matters
    4. No reg, worse localization error

* Timing

    1. Nearly cost free
    2. Less proposal

* Anchors

    1. Scale is more effective


# 4 Efficient One-shot Methods #

    2. w, h are width and height relative to the whole image
    3. the score is a measure of objectness

* Each grid cell predicts C conditional class probabilities
